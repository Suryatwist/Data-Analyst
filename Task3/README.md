# Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis

## üìÑ Summary
This project focuses on performing comprehensive data analysis using Structured Query Language (SQL) on a simulated e-commerce database. The objective is to extract meaningful insights from relational data by employing a range of SQL techniques, including data selection, conditional filtering, sorting, grouping, joining multiple tables, writing subqueries, performing aggregate calculations, and optimizing queries using indexes. Additionally, views are created to encapsulate complex logic for reusable and efficient reporting. The output of each query is captured through screenshots, and all SQL commands are documented in a structured script file for reproducibility. This project demonstrates practical data manipulation and querying skills essential for roles in data analytics, data engineering, and business intelligence.

## üìå Objective
Use SQL queries to extract, analyze, and manipulate data from a relational database using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

## üõ† Tools
- MySQL 8.0.42 (or PostgreSQL / SQLite)
- Command Line Client / MySQL Workbench
- Screenshot tool (Snipping Tool, Flameshot, etc.)

## üìÅ Deliverables
- SQL script: `task3_queries.sql`
- Screenshots of query outputs in `.png` format
- This README file

## üìä Dataset
- `ecommerce_db` (can also use similar datasets like `chocolate_sales`)

---

## üîç Queries Overview

### a. Basic SQL Queries
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`

### b. JOINS
- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`

### c. Subqueries
- Nested `SELECT` statements

### d. Aggregate Functions
- `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`

### e. Views for Analysis
- SQL `CREATE VIEW` statements for reusable query logic

### f. Optimization
- `CREATE INDEX` on frequently accessed columns
